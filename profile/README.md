# Keystone AI

**On-prem AI knowledge infrastructure for highly regulated organizations.**

Keystone is a reference architecture and tooling stack for building
enterprise-grade retrieval-augmented AI systems that operate fully on-prem,
with first-class support for:

- Data sovereignty & air-gapped environments  
- Access-controlled RAG pipelines  
- Audit logging & evidence-grade traceability  
- Defense, aerospace, energy, and critical-infrastructure workflows  

This organization contains:

| Repository | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| keystone-core | RAG ingestion, indexing, query pipeline |
| keystone-gov | ACLs, audit logs, policy enforcement |
| keystone-lab | On-prem lab architecture & runbooks |
| keystone-demo | Regulated-industry demo datasets |
| keystone-docs | Architecture & compliance mapping |

Keystone is not a SaaS toy.  
It is infrastructure for organizations that **cannot afford to leak, lose, or hallucinate knowledge**.
